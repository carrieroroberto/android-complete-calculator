👨🏻‍💻 Main functionalities:

➡ <b>Resolve expressions</b>: also complex expressions (multiple parenthesis, powers, square roots, sums, subtractions, divisions, multiplications).
<br>
➡ <b>Convert into binary</b>: you can convert the real time result into binary (and vice-versa) whenever you want.
<br>
➡ <b>Store the result</b>: you can store temporary a result and use it later in another expression.
<br>
➡ <b>Delete only what you want</b>: you don't need to delete all; there is a specific button to delete just the last entered number.
